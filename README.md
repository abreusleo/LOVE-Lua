# LOVE-Lua
Dedicated to studies aimed at exploring the potential of the Lua language. This repository was created by me and contains the projects I used to understand a bit more about how the LOVE2d framework works.

## SAND
This project draws inspiration from a Genuary project by [Pietro Pepe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pietro-pepe-045224a1/), chosen as an excellent starting point for my Lua + LOVE2d studies.
